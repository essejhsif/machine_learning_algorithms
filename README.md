## Linear Regression

Linear Regression is is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. In other words, an atempt is made to 'fit' a linear equation to the observed data. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. Linear Regression is used to estimate real values - the cost of houses, the total number of calls, sum total of sales, etc.  sales - based on one or more continuous variables. 

When using Linear Regression, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a 'best line.' A line of best fit, or best fit line, is also known as regression line. This does not necessarily imply that one variable *causes* the other variable, but that there is some significant association between the two variables. A 'simple' linear regression can be represented by the equation y = a + b * X, where x is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0). If here appears to be no association between the proposed explanatory (i.e. X) and dependent (i.e. y) variables - that is, an increasing or decreasing trend does not appear apparent - then fitting a linear regression model will probably not be a useful model. 

So. What do we mean by all of this?
